## 📖 About the Project

This is a group project for the Lexicon Frontend Development 2025 course, aimed at creating a complete e-commerce platform using modern web technologies. The platform displays products from an external API (DummyJSON), is fully responsive, and includes interactive features such as product filtering, dynamic routing, and an admin panel. The project provided hands-on experience working with Next.js 15 App Router, Server and Client Components, and agile teamwork using SCRUM methodology.
